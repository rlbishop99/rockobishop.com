    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/testphp.png" class="embeddedPhoto"/>
    <p>I'm a Senior at the University of North Texas, studying to graduate with a degree in Computer Science. I enjoy development, but I'm not sure what I want to focus on yet. 
    I enjoy video game development, and am currently learning HTML, PHP, and CSS. You can click

    <h3>Career Interests</h3>
    <p>I'm currently interested in video game design and software development. I hope to work in a team of knowledgeable people to make games or
       programs that have an impact.</p>
    <h2>I'm eager to get started!</h2>

    <h2>Skills and Tools</h2>
    <h5>General Knowledge:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Computer Hardware Repair/Building</li>
      <li>Unity</li>
      <li>Aesprite</li>
      <li>Adobe Premiere Pro</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I've been researching and building computers for over 7 years. I use my current build to practice my game development skills using the Unity 
       engine, and Aesprite to make my pixel art assets. I used to make small-scale low budget short 'films' and edited them with Adobe Premiere Pro.
       I'm constantly trying to learn new things, and I hope to expand this section with more concrete skills soon!
    </p>
    <h5>Software Development:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>C#</li>
      <li>C++</li>
      <li>Some Java</li>
      <li>Some Python</li>
      <li>Git</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I use Unity to do game development, so I believe I'm most proficient with the C# programming language. I've studied C++ the most throughout
       my college career, so I have a solid understanding of the syntax and logic that comes with the language. I have minor experience with Java
       and Python, and am working on developing those skills to one day be marketable. I use Git to host my major projects - becoming more
       familiar with version control has been incredibly helpful as I've undergone my programming education.
    </p>
    <h5>Web Development:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>React</li>
      <li>SSH</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm quite new to Web Development. This website has been my first real project since I've begun learning. I primarily format my websites using
       HTML and CSS. I'm trying to learn how to best integrate PHP and JavaScript functionality into my websites, but it is an ongoing process. I host my websites on
       a Raspberry Pi, so I use SSH and Git to make sure my remote repositories are in sync with the local repositories on the Pi. 
       Controlling my Pi from anywhere in the world means I can do Web Development when I'm not at my desk, which is amazing.
