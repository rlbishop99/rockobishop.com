    <h2 style="padding: 20px 0 0 0; color:#c8c8c8; max-width: 1300px; min-width: 100px; margin:0 auto;">This short physics-based game was developed over the course of 36 hours for a Game Jam. We were given a pallete of premade 1-bit art assets
        and were told to use those assets exclusively to create the most fun/creative game that we could imagine. I decided to make a game about a chicken
        egg that was trying to "eggscape" the chicken coop out of fear of being eaten. The egg moves with a physics body and moves kinetically through impulses.

        It was the first Game Jam I had ever participated in, and it was the first time I had made a full game that was playable from start to finish.
        There are absolutely some issues: I naively tied physics to frame rate/refresh rate, so some of the physics make the game unplayable if you aren't playing on a 60hz monitor. (Which, let's be honest, most of us aren't at this point!)
        I certainly learned a lot while making it, it taught me a lot about debugging, code review, creativity, and good code optimization practices.
        I wouldn't try to argue that this game is GOOD, but it is playable (on 60hz monitors) and should be bug-free! Have fun!
